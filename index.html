                <h3>Elephant Identification via Eye Wrinkles (Deep Learning, Computer Vision)</h3>
                <p>Elephants have unique wrinkle patterns around their eyes, making them identifiable like human fingerprints. This project leverages CNN-based deep learning models to classify individual Asian elephants using ResNet152 for feature extraction.

ðŸ”¹ Achieved 85% accuracy in elephant identification, improving recognition reliability.
ðŸ”¹ Expanded the dataset size by 200% using image augmentation techniques.
ðŸ”¹ Combined traditional computer vision methods (Canny edges, SSIM) with deep learning to boost</p>

                <h3>E-Commerce Sales Dashboard (Power BI, Business Intelligence)</h3>
                <p>This interactive Power BI dashboard provides insights into sales trends (2015-2018) by analyzing customer segmentation, revenue trends, and order patterns.
ðŸ”¹ Implemented DAX functions to calculate profit margins and forecasting trends.
ðŸ”¹ Used dynamic slicers & drill-through filters for deep insights.
ðŸ”¹ Integrated heatmaps & trendlines for better KPI tracking.</p>

                <h3>Causal Impact of Grants on Education</h3>
                <p>Does grant funding actually improve education outcomes? This project uses causal inference (DoWhy, EconML) to assess how 160+ economic & demographic factors influence high school graduation rates.

ðŸ”¹ Found that grants increased graduation rates by 1.7% over a decade.
ðŸ”¹ Applied binary & continuous treatment effect modeling to analyze funding impacts.
ðŸ”¹ Used robust refutation tests (p-value = 1.0) to validate findings.</p>

                <h3>Bridge Pledge â€“ Predicting Bipartisan Scores for Legislators (ML, Data Science)</h3>
                <p>This project predicts bipartisan Bridge Scores for U.S. legislators using machine learning to evaluate how objective and transparent lawmakers are. It replaces manual scoring with an automated ML pipeline for efficiency.
ðŸ”¹ Built a Random Forest Regressor with hyperparameter tuning, achieving RÂ² = 0.85.
ðŸ”¹ Designed a real-time metric integration system for continuous scoring updates.
ðŸ”¹ Created visualizations of score distributions and learning curves to explain model behavior.</p>
