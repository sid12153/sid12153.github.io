# Siddharth Gosawi – Data Science Portfolio

This repository hosts my personal **Data Science and Analytics portfolio**, showcasing real-world projects across **machine learning, decision intelligence, business analytics, and AI systems**.

The focus of this portfolio is not just modeling, but **end-to-end problem solving** — from raw data and metrics to interpretable models and decision-ready insights.
